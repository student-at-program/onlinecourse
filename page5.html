                    <p>Assistive technology comes in many forms to fit a lot of different contexts. To get a clearer idea of what some kinds of assistive technology look like, please watch the two videos below:</p>
                    <ul >
                        <li class="bodyli"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g95TO20hnmo" target="_blank">Video profile of Elle</a>, who communicates with others through assistive technology. In this case, Elle uses a tablet device with software to assist her in communicating her thoughts.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEW-eqRvARg" taerget="_blank">AT Hackathon video profile</a> of Team Lilly, who uses a walker. Although a walker may not seem as complicated as an electronic device, the video shows how much room for improvement and good engineering there was to help create a walker that would suit Lilly's needs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Though AT comes in many forms, we will focus on mechanical devices in this class. So, we will focus on designing physical objects/tools, like Lilly's walker, rather than an electronic device or software like the ones that Elle uses.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Research</h3>
                    <p>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) hosts a podcast Milestones, in which they feature research into child health and human development. In this episode, Dr. Alison Cernich (director of NICHDâ€™s National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research) talks about different kinds of research into assistive technology. We would like you to listen to this episode of <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/newsroom/news/080718-boosting-mobility-podcast" taerget="_blank">NICHD Podcast: Boosting Mobility for People with Disabilities</a>. (The website includes a transcript of the podcast as well.) We would also like you to take a look at "<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/rehabtech/conditioninfo/device" target="_blank">NICHD Resource: What are some types of assistive devices and how are they used?</a>" for a few more examples of assistive technology.</p>
