                    <p>In short, assistive technology is a device or a program that helps someone function in their daily life. More specifically, people with disabilities use assistive technology to overcome social, technological, or physical barriers in a range of settings. For example, someone might use:</p>
                    <ul >
                        <li class="bodyli">a motorized wheelchair to get around in public,</li>

                    <!-- fix css for the links -->
                    <p>The term "assistive technology" can have a different focus depending on the context in which it's being discussed.
                        <br><br>For a general introduction, we would like you to watch the video from the PACER Center, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB9pKkZoJDc&feature=youtu.be' target="_blank">"Understanding Assistive Technology: Simply Said"</a>. The PACER Center, as a social service nonprofit organization, focuses more on how assistive technologies fit into families' lives.
                        <br><br>We would also like you to read the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/mrc-assistive-technology-services' target="_blank">definition of "assistive technology" from the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission</a>. The MRC, as part of the Massachusetts state government, focuses more on assistive technology as it relates to government programs. For example, some kinds of assistive technology are necessary in schools under federal law, or qualify for individual payment from statewide programs.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">What is a disability?</h2>
                    <p>In short, disability is a condition that impairs someone's daily life activities. A disability might be permanent or temporary. It might be physical, cognitive, or sensory. Someone might be born with a disability, or they
                        might acquire it later in life. A person might have a disability that is visible to the rest of the world, or they might have a disability that is imperceptible to others around them.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Multiple Views</h3>
                    <p>As with the term "assistive technology", the term "disability" can have a different focus depending on the context in which it is being discussed.
                        <br><br>We would like you to read the <a href="https://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/" target="_blank">World Health Organization (WHO) definition of "disability"</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/disabilities" target="_blank">WHO Facts in Pictures: Disability slideshow</a>. We would also like you to watch two WHO videos: 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QXcFk4kvA" taget ="_blank">What's disability to me? Faustina's story"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_2ZEwhh9WQ" target="_blank">"What's disability to me? Mia's story".</a> While the WHO is concerned with health, their focus on disability is not just a focus on physical or mental well-being. The WHO acknowledges that disability is the result of a complex interaction between a person and the society they live in. For the WHO, disability involves physical/mental health, as well as human rights, inclusiveness, and social support. Notice their language around "disabling barriers", or things in society that cause problems for people with disabilities. If such societal barriers were removed, a particular condition might not actually be considered a disability.
                        <br><br>We would also like you to read <a href="https://www.olmsteadrights.org/self-helptools/about-advocacy/" target="_blank">About Self Advocacy" by OlmsteadRights</a> and <a href="https://www.olmsteadrights.org/about-olmstead/item.6460-The_Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990_ADA" target="_blank">THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990 - ADA"</a>. OlmsteadRights is a project by the Disability Integration Project at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. As such, their focus on disability focuses more on legal advocacy and protections for the independence of people with disabilities. Compared to the WHO, OlmsteadRights discussions of disability focus more on countering discrimination and institutionalization of people with disabilities.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">In This Course: People with Disabilities as Co-Designers</h2>
                    <p>This week, we hope to get you thinking about assistive technology and disability in ways that will be useful as an engineer and designer. Just as there is no universal experience of disability, there is no universal list of solutions for problems in people's daily lives. As an engineer/designer, you need to be prepared to work on solutions for clients in situations you may not be used to. As such, your job will not be to step in and tell people how to solve their problems.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Clients/Co-Designers</h3>
                    <p>In this class you will learn how to work with a client with a disability as a <b>co-designer</b>. Though clients will typically take an active role in the design process, it is especially important to work with people with disabilities to solve accessibility related issues. Designing <i>with</i> people with disabilities instead of <i>for</i> people with disabilities helps make sure the resulting products don't cause more problems than they solve.
                        <br><br>Further, we use the term <b>co-designer</b> to emphasize the role of people with disabilities as active partners in the design process. Co-designers set design specifications and make sure the resulting product actually makes sense as a tool that someone can use to overcome a barrier in daily life.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Product Specifications</h3>
                    <p>In this class we will also talk about "product specifications" as the set of requirements or needs that an engineering design product must meet. In the context of assistive technology, this explicitly includes the accessibility needs of co-designers. Although accessibility should always be a concern in design/engineering projects, our product specifications in this course will relate to specific accessibility barriers. Thus the product must help someone overcome those barriers and not cause any new ones in order to be considered a success.</p>
                    <!-- next page 4-->
                    <h2 class = "headers">Reflect</h2>
                    <p>As you move forward in this class, we hope you will remember that assistive technology and disability are dynamic concepts. They take on different shades of meaning depending on a specific person's context. The challenges and the rewards of this class will come from figuring out how to apply several different kinds of knowledge/experience into a specific problem-solving context.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">AT in Action</h2>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Real World Users</h3>
                    <p>Assistive technology comes in many forms to fit a lot of different contexts. To get a clearer idea of what some kinds of assistive technology look like, please watch the two videos below:</p>
                    <ul >
                        <li class="bodyli"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g95TO20hnmo" target="_blank">Video profile of Elle</a>, who communicates with others through assistive technology. In this case, Elle uses a tablet device with software to assist her in communicating her thoughts.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEW-eqRvARg" taerget="_blank">AT Hackathon video profile</a> of Team Lilly, who uses a walker. Although a walker may not seem as complicated as an electronic device, the video shows how much room for improvement and good engineering there was to help create a walker that would suit Lilly's needs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Though AT comes in many forms, we will focus on mechanical devices in this class. So, we will focus on designing physical objects/tools, like Lilly's walker, rather than an electronic device or software like the ones that Elle uses.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Research</h3>
                    <p>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) hosts a podcast Milestones, in which they feature research into child health and human development. In this episode, Dr. Alison Cernich (director of NICHD’s National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research) talks about different kinds of research into assistive technology. We would like you to listen to this episode of <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/newsroom/news/080718-boosting-mobility-podcast" taerget="_blank">NICHD Podcast: Boosting Mobility for People with Disabilities</a>. (The website includes a transcript of the podcast as well.) We would also like you to take a look at "<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/rehabtech/conditioninfo/device" target="_blank">NICHD Resource: What are some types of assistive devices and how are they used?</a>" for a few more examples of assistive technology.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">AT as an Engineering Design Product</h2>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Clients/Co-Designers</h3>
                    <p>This course focuses on assistive technology as an engineering design product. That means we'll develop a technological solution to a very specific problem defined by a "client" with a disability. In this course's design process, we will treat the client as a "co-designer." It is important to remember that our co-designers are experts on the nature of their design problem and on what solutions will actually work to suit their own needs and abilities.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">The Scope of a Solution</h3>
                    <p>As the readings from this week highlight, it's important to remember that disability involves a complex interaction between a person and the society they live in. For
                        example, voice recognition software that would help someone use a computer hands-free might look a lot like personal assistant software that is widely used on smartphones. As another example, most people with prescription glasses probably wouldn't consider that an example of assistive technology, even if they couldn't drive, bike, or participate fully in a classroom setting without them. These observations are related to the role that society play's in determining what is a disability and what is assistive technology.
                        <br><br>You might also notice that assistive technology solves problems that might be prevented from happening again through changes in industry, law, or social norms. While these social solutions to broad accessibility problems are necessary, this class will focus on more immediate solutions to personalized problems.
                        <br><br>For example, a co-designer with one arm might be interested in a way to more easily use the zippers on their coats. A solution outside the scope of this class might be to work with clothing designers on making adaptable clothing options the norm in the fashion industry so that people with physical disabilities can shop in any store to find functional clothing they like. A solution we might focus on in this class would be to engineer a tool that someone can use with one hand to help close up the zippers on any article of clothing. It's important to note that both of these approaches would be important parts of addressing accessibility issues in fashion long-term: an engineer might be able to show that creating an accessible zipper is possible, and someone trying to change the fashion industry might help spread that engineering solution more widely.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Looking Ahead</h3>
                    <p>In this class, we hope to help you develop engineering skills you can use to address issues that people with disabilities face today. By the end of the class, we hope you feel more comfortable working on issues related to disability and analyzing whether the products you design in the future are accessible to people with disabilities. These skills will help you work on assistive technology projects in the future, as well as strengthen your design skills to be a better engineer overall.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">What you will learn</h2>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Overview</h3>
                    <p>Before diving into the specifics of product design, we want to define what we will be covering. The first distinction we want to make is between research and development. <b>Research</b> is a highly unpredictable, but systematic process of discovery that deals with novel technologies with unstructured methods. <b>Development</b> is a more predictable planned process to create novel products with mostly known technologies using structured methods. Our focus in the Design for Assistive Technology course will be on development not research.
                        <br><br>Also there is a distinction to make about whether the product we are developing is a market pull or technology push product. <b>Market-pull</b> products are developed after a market opportunity has been identified and is designed to meet customer needs. For <b>technology-push products</b>, development starts with a new technology and finds a market afterward. Our focus will be on market-pull technology.
                        <br><br>The reason for this focus is that we will be designing to a specific customer need. In this case a person with a disability will have a problem that can be solved with technology and therefore our customer base and therefore market are defined as that disability community.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Product Development Process Flows</h3>
                    <p>There are many process flows that have been used by teams to design new products. One determining factor on what development process to choose is whether your project is mainly hardware or software. For software, different development processes, for example, Agile have been shown to be very effective. For hardware the processes, it is more difficult, and variations on a general process flow is used.
                        <br><br>The general process flow for hardware product development is shown. We will be covering gathering user preferences, concept generation and selection in Section 1. We will be covering prototyping loops with components of design, build, test in Section 2.

                    <h2 class = "headers">Consumer Needs and Product Specifications</h2>
                    <p>Identifying customer needs is a crucial step in the development process. The development team must create a complete set of <b>customer need statements</b>. To accomplish this interviews or focus groups with customers must be done and the raw data from these interactions analyzed and prioritized for design.
                        <b>customer need statement:</b> Taking what the customer states in an interview or focus group and transferring that into a positive, specific product attribute that addresses this concern.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Product Specifications</h3>
                    <p>Once customer needs statements have been created, these are turned into preliminary <b>product specifications</b>. To do this effectively, needs can be categorized into a hierarchy including primary "must-haves", secondary "nice-to-haves" and tertiary "neutral" needs.
                        <br><br><b>product specifications</b> are a list of statements that describe what the product has to do in measurable terms.
                        <br><br>For example, for a vacuum cleaner here is a customer needs statement turned into a product specification:
                        <br><br>Customer need statement: "I need to be able to clean up confetti after parties in the conference room"
                        <br>Product specification: The vacuum cleaner has the power to suck up fragments up to 1 inch in diameter and 0.1 lbs in weight.
                    </p>
