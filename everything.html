                    <p>In short, assistive technology is a device or a program that helps someone function in their daily life. More specifically, people with disabilities use assistive technology to overcome social, technological, or physical barriers in a range of settings. For example, someone might use:</p>
                    <ul >
                        <li class="bodyli">a motorized wheelchair to get around in public,</li>

                    <!-- fix css for the links -->
                    <p>The term "assistive technology" can have a different focus depending on the context in which it's being discussed.
                        <br><br>For a general introduction, we would like you to watch the video from the PACER Center, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB9pKkZoJDc&feature=youtu.be' target="_blank">"Understanding Assistive Technology: Simply Said"</a>. The PACER Center, as a social service nonprofit organization, focuses more on how assistive technologies fit into families' lives.
                        <br><br>We would also like you to read the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/mrc-assistive-technology-services' target="_blank">definition of "assistive technology" from the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission</a>. The MRC, as part of the Massachusetts state government, focuses more on assistive technology as it relates to government programs. For example, some kinds of assistive technology are necessary in schools under federal law, or qualify for individual payment from statewide programs.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">What is a disability?</h2>
                    <p>In short, disability is a condition that impairs someone's daily life activities. A disability might be permanent or temporary. It might be physical, cognitive, or sensory. Someone might be born with a disability, or they
                        might acquire it later in life. A person might have a disability that is visible to the rest of the world, or they might have a disability that is imperceptible to others around them.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Multiple Views</h3>
                    <p>As with the term "assistive technology", the term "disability" can have a different focus depending on the context in which it is being discussed.
                        <br><br>We would like you to read the <a href="https://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/" target="_blank">World Health Organization (WHO) definition of "disability"</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/disabilities" target="_blank">WHO Facts in Pictures: Disability slideshow</a>. We would also like you to watch two WHO videos: 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QXcFk4kvA" taget ="_blank">What's disability to me? Faustina's story"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_2ZEwhh9WQ" target="_blank">"What's disability to me? Mia's story".</a> While the WHO is concerned with health, their focus on disability is not just a focus on physical or mental well-being. The WHO acknowledges that disability is the result of a complex interaction between a person and the society they live in. For the WHO, disability involves physical/mental health, as well as human rights, inclusiveness, and social support. Notice their language around "disabling barriers", or things in society that cause problems for people with disabilities. If such societal barriers were removed, a particular condition might not actually be considered a disability.
                        <br><br>We would also like you to read <a href="https://www.olmsteadrights.org/self-helptools/about-advocacy/" target="_blank">About Self Advocacy" by OlmsteadRights</a> and <a href="https://www.olmsteadrights.org/about-olmstead/item.6460-The_Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990_ADA" target="_blank">THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990 - ADA"</a>. OlmsteadRights is a project by the Disability Integration Project at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. As such, their focus on disability focuses more on legal advocacy and protections for the independence of people with disabilities. Compared to the WHO, OlmsteadRights discussions of disability focus more on countering discrimination and institutionalization of people with disabilities.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">In This Course: People with Disabilities as Co-Designers</h2>
                    <p>This week, we hope to get you thinking about assistive technology and disability in ways that will be useful as an engineer and designer. Just as there is no universal experience of disability, there is no universal list of solutions for problems in people's daily lives. As an engineer/designer, you need to be prepared to work on solutions for clients in situations you may not be used to. As such, your job will not be to step in and tell people how to solve their problems.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Clients/Co-Designers</h3>
                    <p>In this class you will learn how to work with a client with a disability as a <b>co-designer</b>. Though clients will typically take an active role in the design process, it is especially important to work with people with disabilities to solve accessibility related issues. Designing <i>with</i> people with disabilities instead of <i>for</i> people with disabilities helps make sure the resulting products don't cause more problems than they solve.
                        <br><br>Further, we use the term <b>co-designer</b> to emphasize the role of people with disabilities as active partners in the design process. Co-designers set design specifications and make sure the resulting product actually makes sense as a tool that someone can use to overcome a barrier in daily life.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Product Specifications</h3>
                    <p>In this class we will also talk about "product specifications" as the set of requirements or needs that an engineering design product must meet. In the context of assistive technology, this explicitly includes the accessibility needs of co-designers. Although accessibility should always be a concern in design/engineering projects, our product specifications in this course will relate to specific accessibility barriers. Thus the product must help someone overcome those barriers and not cause any new ones in order to be considered a success.</p>
                    <!-- next page 4-->
                    <h2 class = "headers">Reflect</h2>
                    <p>As you move forward in this class, we hope you will remember that assistive technology and disability are dynamic concepts. They take on different shades of meaning depending on a specific person's context. The challenges and the rewards of this class will come from figuring out how to apply several different kinds of knowledge/experience into a specific problem-solving context.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">AT in Action</h2>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Real World Users</h3>
                    <p>Assistive technology comes in many forms to fit a lot of different contexts. To get a clearer idea of what some kinds of assistive technology look like, please watch the two videos below:</p>
                    <ul >
                        <li class="bodyli"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g95TO20hnmo" target="_blank">Video profile of Elle</a>, who communicates with others through assistive technology. In this case, Elle uses a tablet device with software to assist her in communicating her thoughts.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEW-eqRvARg" taerget="_blank">AT Hackathon video profile</a> of Team Lilly, who uses a walker. Although a walker may not seem as complicated as an electronic device, the video shows how much room for improvement and good engineering there was to help create a walker that would suit Lilly's needs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Though AT comes in many forms, we will focus on mechanical devices in this class. So, we will focus on designing physical objects/tools, like Lilly's walker, rather than an electronic device or software like the ones that Elle uses.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Research</h3>
                    <p>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) hosts a podcast Milestones, in which they feature research into child health and human development. In this episode, Dr. Alison Cernich (director of NICHD’s National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research) talks about different kinds of research into assistive technology. We would like you to listen to this episode of <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/newsroom/news/080718-boosting-mobility-podcast" taerget="_blank">NICHD Podcast: Boosting Mobility for People with Disabilities</a>. (The website includes a transcript of the podcast as well.) We would also like you to take a look at "<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/rehabtech/conditioninfo/device" target="_blank">NICHD Resource: What are some types of assistive devices and how are they used?</a>" for a few more examples of assistive technology.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">AT as an Engineering Design Product</h2>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Clients/Co-Designers</h3>
                    <p>This course focuses on assistive technology as an engineering design product. That means we'll develop a technological solution to a very specific problem defined by a "client" with a disability. In this course's design process, we will treat the client as a "co-designer." It is important to remember that our co-designers are experts on the nature of their design problem and on what solutions will actually work to suit their own needs and abilities.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">The Scope of a Solution</h3>
                    <p>As the readings from this week highlight, it's important to remember that disability involves a complex interaction between a person and the society they live in. For
                        example, voice recognition software that would help someone use a computer hands-free might look a lot like personal assistant software that is widely used on smartphones. As another example, most people with prescription glasses probably wouldn't consider that an example of assistive technology, even if they couldn't drive, bike, or participate fully in a classroom setting without them. These observations are related to the role that society play's in determining what is a disability and what is assistive technology.
                        <br><br>You might also notice that assistive technology solves problems that might be prevented from happening again through changes in industry, law, or social norms. While these social solutions to broad accessibility problems are necessary, this class will focus on more immediate solutions to personalized problems.
                        <br><br>For example, a co-designer with one arm might be interested in a way to more easily use the zippers on their coats. A solution outside the scope of this class might be to work with clothing designers on making adaptable clothing options the norm in the fashion industry so that people with physical disabilities can shop in any store to find functional clothing they like. A solution we might focus on in this class would be to engineer a tool that someone can use with one hand to help close up the zippers on any article of clothing. It's important to note that both of these approaches would be important parts of addressing accessibility issues in fashion long-term: an engineer might be able to show that creating an accessible zipper is possible, and someone trying to change the fashion industry might help spread that engineering solution more widely.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Looking Ahead</h3>
                    <p>In this class, we hope to help you develop engineering skills you can use to address issues that people with disabilities face today. By the end of the class, we hope you feel more comfortable working on issues related to disability and analyzing whether the products you design in the future are accessible to people with disabilities. These skills will help you work on assistive technology projects in the future, as well as strengthen your design skills to be a better engineer overall.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">What you will learn</h2>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Overview</h3>
                    <p>Before diving into the specifics of product design, we want to define what we will be covering. The first distinction we want to make is between research and development. <b>Research</b> is a highly unpredictable, but systematic process of discovery that deals with novel technologies with unstructured methods. <b>Development</b> is a more predictable planned process to create novel products with mostly known technologies using structured methods. Our focus in the Design for Assistive Technology course will be on development not research.
                        <br><br>Also there is a distinction to make about whether the product we are developing is a market pull or technology push product. <b>Market-pull</b> products are developed after a market opportunity has been identified and is designed to meet customer needs. For <b>technology-push products</b>, development starts with a new technology and finds a market afterward. Our focus will be on market-pull technology.
                        <br><br>The reason for this focus is that we will be designing to a specific customer need. In this case a person with a disability will have a problem that can be solved with technology and therefore our customer base and therefore market are defined as that disability community.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Product Development Process Flows</h3>
                    <p>There are many process flows that have been used by teams to design new products. One determining factor on what development process to choose is whether your project is mainly hardware or software. For software, different development processes, for example, Agile have been shown to be very effective. For hardware the processes, it is more difficult, and variations on a general process flow is used.
                        <br><br>The general process flow for hardware product development is shown. We will be covering gathering user preferences, concept generation and selection in Section 1. We will be covering prototyping loops with components of design, build, test in Section 2.

                    <h2 class = "headers">Consumer Needs and Product Specifications</h2>
                    <p>Identifying customer needs is a crucial step in the development process. The development team must create a complete set of <b>customer need statements</b>. To accomplish this interviews or focus groups with customers must be done and the raw data from these interactions analyzed and prioritized for design.
                        <b>customer need statement:</b> Taking what the customer states in an interview or focus group and transferring that into a positive, specific product attribute that addresses this concern.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Product Specifications</h3>
                    <p>Once customer needs statements have been created, these are turned into preliminary <b>product specifications</b>. To do this effectively, needs can be categorized into a hierarchy including primary "must-haves", secondary "nice-to-haves" and tertiary "neutral" needs.
                        <br><br><b>product specifications</b> are a list of statements that describe what the product has to do in measurable terms.
                        <br><br>For example, for a vacuum cleaner here is a customer needs statement turned into a product specification:
                        <br><br>Customer need statement: "I need to be able to clean up confetti after parties in the conference room"
                        <br>Product specification: The vacuum cleaner has the power to suck up fragments up to 1 inch in diameter and 0.1 lbs in weight.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">Concept Generation and Selection</h2>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">The Four Steps to Concept Generation</h3>
                    <p><b>Concept generation</b> is an important step in the product development process that can itself be broken down into steps. Going into these steps, you will usually need the customer needs list, preliminary product specification and a mission statement for the project which you created in the previous exercises.
                    <br><br>The steps to the process are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="bodyli">Clarify the problem</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">Search externally</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">Search internally</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">Explore systematically</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">STEP 1: Clarify the Problem</h3>
                    <p>To clarify the problem, breaking the product into smaller subproblems is helpful. This can be done using a <b>functional diagram</b>.
                        <br><br>A <b>functional diagram</b> is something that first breaks down all the inputs and outputs of a product and then walks through how the inputs become the outputs. An example is shown below for a handheld nailer.
                        <br><br>With arrows, the (1) energy, (2) material, and (3) control or signals are indicated. In the case of the screw driver shown here: (1) energy: taken from the electrical outlet and stored in the battery, this energy can then be converted into translational energy that drives the nail, (2) material: in this case the nails, are loaded into the device, isolated before use, and then once energy is applied, the nail is ejected, (3) control or signals: the user trigger the nailer with a button therefore "tripping" the sensor, this triggers the tool which first isolates the nail and then allows energy to be applied to drive the nail.

                    <h3 class="subheaders">STEP 2: External Search</h3>
                    <p>External searching is an important step of the product development process. Performing a thorough external search means that you have found the all the major existing solutions for the problem or subproblems that the functional diagram revealed. There are a few different ways to do this, including lead user interviews, expert consultation, patent searching, literature searching, and competitive benchmarking.
                        <br><br><b>Interview lead users:</b> These are people who stand to gain the most from the new product. Usually, these are people who have already taken some steps to address this need, or at least have thought about how it might be addressed. Within assistive technology fields, lead users can many times be thought of as co-designers who are very involved in the design, build, and testing of the product.
                       <br><br><b>Consult experts:</b> These are professionals who deal with this product or related field within their work, such as university faculty, suppliers, manufacturers of similar products, or medical professionals (especially in the case of assistive technology). These people can lend technical and industry insight, and they can often connect you with those who can. Asking for contacts is important when consulting experts.
                       <br><br><b>Search patents:</b> There are two major functions of patent searching: (1) finding out what has been done and, (2) finding out what is covered by patent and intellectual property laws. Concepts in recent patents are usually protected, meaning you must pay the patent holder to use that technology, but patent laws vary from country to country. We will not be covering patent searches in this course, though if you are designing and marketing your own products, you need to be aware of what the relevant patent laws are like in your country!
                       <br><br><b>Search published literature:</b> This is an often overlooked step in the design process that can lead to doubling work that someone else has already thought about and sometimes implemented! Literature includes journals, trade magazines, government reports, conference proceedings, public information from manufacturers, etc. This search is usually done via internet databases.
                       <br><br><b>Benchmarking related products:</b> Finding and studying existing products that do the same or very similar functions is called benchmarking. If planning to commercialize your product this is like scoping out the competition and the pros and cons of their solution.
                       </p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">STEP 3: Internal Search</h3>
                    <p>This is what most people think of as brainstorming and there are several ways to go about doing this, both in groups and individually. Here are a few tips for successful concept generation internally:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="bodyli"><b>Generate many ideas:</b> The more ideas that are brought into consideration, the more of the full solution space is explored meaning the less likely the team has left out a good solution. This includes suspending judgment of the ideas and accepting seemingly infeasible ideas at first.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli"><b>Draw things out and/or build a model:</b> Making a physical representation of an idea has been shown to lead to better design outcomes. It allows the designers to interact with the idea in a way that gives more information.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli"><b>Make analogies (Design by analogy):</b> Think of devices or products (or solutions) that solve a related problem for insight into your own problem. This includes looking to biological analogies, often called bio-inspired design. This concept has become very popular in engineering and science within the last decades. For some examples see <a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-03/gallery-six-ways-biomimicry-reshaping-future/" target="_blank">this popular science article from 2011</a>.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli"><b>Set quantitative goals and share individual work:</b> It can be helpful for each team member to generate a certain minimum number of concepts and then share with the group to spark further ideas within the group. This can effectively be done with the "gallery method" where each individual can tape a sketched concept to the board and explain that idea.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">STEP 4: Explore Systematically</h3>
                    <p>Once the problem has been clarified, researched externally, internally brainstormed, and many solutions to the subproblems have been found, it is time to explore these in a structured way. There are several ways to go about doing this. One of these ways is by making a pros and cons list for each viable solution.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">What is Prototyping?</h2>
                    <p>In this section we will step through an example of how to iteratively prototype towards a solution.
                        <br><br><b>prototype:</b> a model that a design team builds of a solution to test and validate ideas quickly
                        <br><br>To do this we will be going back to the example of the arm holder for Kenzie, the child with cerebral palsy. In this scenario, Kenzie and her mom are the co-designers and you (and the AT course staff) are the design team creating this device.
                        <br><br>Through the activities in this module, you will work through the design process and learn how to make decisions during prototyping quickly and cheaply towards the best solution.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Mission Statement</h3>
                    <p>You are a part of a team that has this <b>mission statement:</b>
                        <br><br>"To design and build a mobile arm support for children and adults with cerebral palsy that will aid in arm mobilization when working on everyday movements in therapy; specifically eating and writing."</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Benchmarking</h3>
                    <p>The team did some <b>benchmarking</b> during the concept generation phase. Some of those results are here.
                        <br><br>The first system researched was the <a href="https://www.medifab.co.nz/products/therapy/multilink-dynamic-arm-support" target="_blank">Medifab Dynamic Arm Support</a>. The team discussed the pros of this product including its advantages of user-friendly clamp, flexibility in movement, and the simple height adjustment. The major disadvantages include its unwieldy size as well as a lack of tension adjustment. Lastly, it is expensive and difficult to purchase.
                        <br><br>The second system researched was the <a href="http://www.armonproducts.com/products/edero/" target="_blank">Armon Edero</a> which has key elements required by the co-designer, including a clamping mechanism compatible with table and chairs, portability, and all the required axes of rotation with adjustable tension at the joints. The pitfalls of this product include its expense, appearance, and overall safety of moving joints for young users.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Lead User and Experts Survey</h3>
                    <p>
                        The team did a survey with therapists and parents of potential patients who may be interested in the project to gain a better understanding of how the product will be used in the future.
                        <br><br>The team learned these things from the surveys:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="bodyli">Safety is the most important.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">The device needs to be easy to clean and maintain.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">The device needs to be comfortable.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">The device needs to be light and easy to transport.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">The arm support should have more functionality than the movements described (writing and eating)</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">The movement required to eat is the most important function for this device.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">Users will use this device between 1 and 4 hours at a time.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">More than 60% of the participants would not pay over $500 for this device.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>More extensive interviewing and testing was also done until all customer needs were understood by the design team. The next step is to turn these needs into requirements.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Requirements</h3>
                    <p>These requirements are written in technical engineering terms. The terminology may be unfamiliar, but the point of sharing these is to give an example of what real requirements would look like.
                        <br><br>Here are some of the requirements the team defines for the product:</p>
                    <ol>

                        </ul></li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 class="subheaders">Device Concept</h3>
                    <p>Given the requirements made from customer (or co-designer) needs and a rigorous selection process, the concept selected was a ball joint based system with a product breakdown shown here. This shows the components of the system and how they are connected. Level 1 is the entire system. Level 2 and 3 break the system down into the individual components.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">Prototyping Round 1</h2>
                    <p>
                        The team is ready to build the first prototype, which is often referred to as <b>feasibility prototype</b>. This prototype should demonstrate the desired concept, but not necessarily with all the features or materials.
                        <br><br>Often when the feasibility prototype is being done the team doesn't fully know what they are trying to build or what it will look like. In this example, the team already has CAD drawings, but this is not always the case. In other words, prototyping early before everything is perfect is a good idea! Build early and build often.
                        <br><br>In this case, the team is given 3 materials to work with, cardboard, duct tape, and scissors. With this rudimentary set of prototyping tools, the team works to build a model of the arm support system. They mold a card board for a cuff, strengthening and keeping it in place with duct tape. Then a post is added to hold up the arm support.
                    </p>
                    <!-- next page 12 -->
                    <h2 class = "headers">Prototyping Round 2</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this case, the team is not ready to prototype with more expensive materials. Instead, they decide that doing one or two more iterations with cardboard to get the right cuff length would be useful. This is cheap and quick prototyping that will give the team a better idea of how to create a more expensive and time-consuming prototype.
                        <br><br>The team builds two more prototypes until an arm cuff shape has been finalized, using input from the co-designer. It is time to try out more realistic prototyping. Here are the three major components:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="bodyli">The arm cuff is now made out of wood with the design decided on from the cardboard prototypes.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">The team decides to outsource the ball joint design, buying an off-the-shelf component and designing a connector between the clamp and ball joint and arm cuff.</li>
                        <li class="bodyli">Due to metal working expertise in the team, the clamp was prototyped in parallel with the arm cuff using cheap metal scraps.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The team assembles the arm cuff, ball joint, and clamp for the next prototype.</p>

                    <h2 class = "headers">Technical Skills for Assistive Technology</h2>
                    <p>
                        Like general product design, designing products in assistive technology use cases can involve a wide variety of skills. A new wheelchair design might require knowing mechanical engineering. A more accessible website might need some CSS tinkering. A wearable medical monitoring device might require knowing how to sew, and so on.
                        <br><br>In this course, we are focusing more on assistive technologies that have physical/mechanical solutions that can be made for an individual, rather than solutions that primarily involve software, or that involve modifications to infrastructure, for example. Because of this focus, and because of its usefulness in rapid prototyping, we are including a section here to introduce 3D printing and computer-aided design. Remember that these are just two of a multitude of skills and approaches that you might have to an AT problem, and you shouldn't hesitate to consider other approaches when trying to find a solution.

                    <h2 class = "headers">Introduction to CAD and Onshape</h2>
                    <p>When we want to create parts for a product, we typically need to be very specific about their designs. It isn't enough to hand a manufacturer a sketch on a napkin and expect to get back what you had in mind. The same goes when we use technologies such as 3D printing or laser cutting. A 3D printer will certainly have far more trouble understanding your napkin sketch than a human, so we'll need to give the computer information in a format that it understands. This means starting with computer-aided design, or CAD.
                        <br><br>In this module, we'll be introducing you to Onshape, a web-based CAD program that will allow you to create sketches, 3D parts, and assemblies, that can be used to design a prototype, and used for manufacturing (e.g. 3D printing a part). Many other options for CAD tools exist out there, but Onshape has the convenience of being free for academic use, and putting everyone on the same platform (mostly) regardless of hardware specs.
                        <br><br>Please create an account for <a href="https://www.onshape.com/products/education" target="_blank">Onshape Education</a>, using the "Get Started" button. <b>This should be a free account.</b>
